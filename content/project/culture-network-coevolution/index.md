What we can learn from others, such as skills that help us to cope with our environment, is largely determined by who we interact with. For example, larger and more dense social networks, where each individual interacts with many other individuals, are known to spread new behaviours or information faster and further than sparse networks ([Centola, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1185231); [Derex & Boyd, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518798113)). However, it is largely unknown whether the nature of what we need to learn to survive affects our social behaviour and ultimately the structure of the social network.

In this project, I develop an agent-based simulation model together with Erol Ak√ßay to better understand the feedback between culture and network structure.
