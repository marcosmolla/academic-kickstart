Marco Smolla is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Theoretical Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. His research focusses broadly on the evolutionary origins and dynamics of social behaviours, such as individual cooperation, group coordination, and cultural evolution. In previous projects he studied self-organisation and division of labour in social insects, and later expanded on this topic by looking at the effect of competition on the utility of social learning, the fundamental mechanism that allows culture to evolve. At his current position in Philadelphia, he studies the co-evolution of culture and population structure. 

He is interested in the complex feedbacks between individual actors, the group, and the environment. His goal is to use theory to guide research questions, produce testable hypothesis, and build bridges between the diverse disciplines involved in the study of cultural evolution.
